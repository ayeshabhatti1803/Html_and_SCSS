I have created a portfolio to showcase my skills and projects.

I implemented the following :

Sass:

Enabled me to break different components down into separate Sass files, with the potential to re-use elements in projects.

CSS Grid & Flexbox:

I created fluid layouts throughout the page with a mixture of Grid and Flexbox. The website is fully responsive on multiple screen widths.

JavaScript:

I created functions to animate the navbar or the section titles, depending on the scroll position on the page.

Deployment:

Once the Sass and Font-Awesome files were bundled into a single CSS file, after that I have deploy my website with GitHub Pages.
